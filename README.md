<h1>Can you Guess My Secret Number?</h1>

<h2>Guess The Number</h2>
A single-player game where you match wits against a Genie to guess his Secret Number!

<h2>How to Play:</h2>
To start the game, click the button that reads "Open Sesame".  Click ok to start guessing.  (Note:  If you click cancel, the game will end and you will be invited to come back another time.) The Genie tells you that you have 3 chances to guess his Secret Number.  With each entry, that does not match his Secret Number, you will be given a hint.  If you use all 3 chances and do not guess, the game ends, however, you will be given the option to try again.  If you guess the Genie's Secret Number within 3 guesses, you will be granted a wish with instructions on how to proceed.  It's a simple and fun game.  You'll have fun!
